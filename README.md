This is the code repository for [R Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/r-data-structures-and-algorithms?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=Repository&utm_campaign=9781786465153), published by Packt. 
**Increase speed and performance of your applications with efficient data structures and algorithms**

## What is this book about?
We begin by answering the fundamental question: why data structures? In this book, we cover not only classical data structures, but also functional data structures.
This book covers the following exciting features:
* The intricacies of high performance and scalable programming using R
*	The rationality behind data structures and algorithms
*	Fundamentals of arrays and linked-based data structures
*	Dynamic programming (Knapsack) and randomized algorithms

This easy-to-read book is packed with real-world examples, and with its fast-paced nature, it will improve the productivity of an R programmer and improve the performance of R applications. If you feel this book is for you, get your [copy](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Dr-Prakash-ebook/dp/B01IF7NLIC/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1521014648&sr=8-2&keywords=R+Data+Structures+and+Algorithms) today!

You can purchase this book at Amazon [R Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1786465159)

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
if (test expression)
{
  Statement upon condition is true
}
```

You will need a good understanding of R or another programming language. Preliminary experience of programming and data analysis will be helpful as well. You will need to appreciate algorithms that can be applied in scale to build applications.

Package in R can be installed using install.packages(“Package-name”)

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-10)
